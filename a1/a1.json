{"pl-name": "C programming", "project-name": "Turing machine", "project-description": "In this assignment you will implement a Turing Machine (TM) in C. A TM consists of:\n\nAn infinite tape, divided into cells\nA read/write head which traverses along the tape, capable of reading the current cell, writing a new value in the current cell, and moving left or right\nA state register\nA finite table of instructions which, given the current state of the machine, and the value in the tape cell currently being read, retrieves an instruction which tells the machine to:\nWrite some (possibly the same) item into the cell\nMove the head left or right one cell\nChange to some (possibly the same) state"}
