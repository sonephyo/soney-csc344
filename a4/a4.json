{"pl-name": "ASP", "project-name": "Social Distancing Simulator", "project-description": "You\u2019re trying really hard to adhere to social distancing rules, but sometimes your visits to the local park aren\u2019t so easy. You\u2019re trying to get from a point on the south side of the park to a nice patch of grass on the north side. There are several people around and sometimes they aren\u2019t trying as hard as you to do the right thing. But you\u2019ve had a great idea! You launch a drone and create a map of the current location of all of the people in the park. Now you just have to write a little program to find a path such that you stay 6 feet away from every other park-goer!"}
